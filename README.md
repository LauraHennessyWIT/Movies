# Movies
The purpose of the Movie app is to allow users to store a list of their favourite movies. The user can add the movie title, 
movie description, runtime and the link to the movie trailer on Youtube. Once added, the movie is added to a list. The user
can also update and delete movies from the list. The trailer link is clickable so opens up Youtube in a Chrome 
browser and plays the movie trailer. If the user closes the app, all of the movies added to the list will be stored.
